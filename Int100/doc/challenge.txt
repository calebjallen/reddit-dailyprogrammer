Paste of source for preservation (in case reddit dies):

Write a program called 'censor' that takes in one argument on the command line.  This argument is the filename of a newline-separated wordlist of profanity such as

http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/2008/04/04/bad-words-list/ or

http://www.bannedwordlist.com/SwearWordResources.htm

The program should then read a text from standard in, and print it out again, but replacing every instance of a word in the wordlist with a 'censored' version.
The censored version of a word has the same first character as the word, and the rest of the characters are replaced with '*'.  

For example, the 'censored' version of 'peter' would be 'p****'

Example: 

    >echo 'You jerkface!' | censor badwords.txt
    You j***face!

**Initial Thoughts/Rambling**
    - Well, the links are dead for the word lists. This is a great start. Maybe some requirements need to change.
    - Found a list of swear words from some random site. They're not really swears though... since when was alcoholic ever a swear word? (found from http://www.hyperhero.com/en/insults.htm , the full list I use will be in /assets though)
    - Some of these swears are ridiculous, 'Rufian'?! Whatever. It's a list of words and phrases I can use.
    - I wonder if employers will look at this in the future. That'd be hilarious.

**The Plan**
    - Language of Choice: Python 3, I feel like the easy regex usage might help us out a bit (I haven't used python in months though, so let's see how this goes...)
    - Probably going to start by putting all the swears into a list, then have regex find each instance of every word in the file and replace it with a concatenation of the first letter of the swear and the appropriate amount of asterisks.
    - Problem with that: if a word (eg: jerk) is a subset of another word (eg: jerkface), it'll censor jerk if jerkface is found, but not the 'face' part, since the word will not be 'j***face'.
    - Solution: read the list backwards, since our swears.txt is alphebatized. (this kind of a fix is probably a bad idea, but I'm rolling with it.)
